QUESTIONS
Does archive page default to showing ALL projects? And then the dropdown is just a search?
	A: Default to showing only search bar
Can we delete projects?
Do we need an owner for projects?
Do we need to add required asterisks to fields on modal forms?
Should we be able to edit/see status of the project on the project show page?
Can users add tasks to their "my tasks" page?
